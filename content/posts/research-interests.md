## Overview
My current research focuses on the intersection of **[Insert Field]** and **[Insert Application]**. I am particularly interested in how we can use computational tools to solve complex real-world problems.

## Primary Research Areas

### 1. [Specific Topic A]
Explain a bit about your first interest here. What is the problem you are looking at? Why does it matter?

### 2. [Specific Topic B]
Describe your second area of interest. Mention any specific methodologies or tools you enjoy using (e.g., Python, R, Hugo, etc.).

## Future Goals
I am currently looking for collaborators or mentors in the field of **[Topic]**. If you are working on something similar, I would love to connect!
